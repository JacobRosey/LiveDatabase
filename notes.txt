current issues -

Figured out how to get the table to get live updates, however....
The table is only rendered the second time the /database route is visited
Also the console.log shows an empty array but the data is rendered? wtf is 
going on

need to figure out how to edit/delete rows based on index of row.
I can delete the correct row now, but I need to keep track of which records have been deleted, or just 
refresh the page after sql query is completed (easier solution). If not, the wrong rows would be edited 
if you just deleted a shit ton of records then edited. the indexes get fucked up because handlebars only 
renders them once, on page load


Need to make it so you have to be logged in to edit/delete rows, just so there's 
actually a point to logging in. Then the project is finished
